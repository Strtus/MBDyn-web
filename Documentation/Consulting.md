# Consulting


**MBDyn** is a general purpose analysis tool developed at the 
[_Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Aerospaziali_](https://www.aero.polimi.it)
of the University "[_Politecnico di Milano_](https://www.polimi.it)" 
for research. Eventually it gained nearly industrial strength and has 
been released as source code to the _free software_ community.

However the developers are aware of the fact (and strongly warn potential users)
that it comes **AS IS AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY** 
(see the [_licensing issues_]({{ "/Download.html#license" | relative_url }}) and the
[_disclaimer_]({{ "/Download.html#disclaimer" | relative_url }}) for further details). Moreover, its use is not trivial and, like most engineering analysis and design codes, it requires a strong background in Structural Mechanics, Finite Element Analysis and Computational Mechanics in general.

To this extent the developers offer consulting services aimed at both 
training users and solving specific problems. 
The consulting services may be accessed by establishing a grant, 
or a research, consulting or training contract with the 
[_Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Aerospaziali_](https://www.aero.polimi.it)
 of the University "[_Politecnico di Milano_](https://www.polimi.it)".

In the spirit of the [Project]({{ "/Team.html" | relative_url }}), 
enhancements to **MBDyn** resulting from these grants should be 
made available to the community of the users under the same license 
of **MBDyn**, namely the GNU Free Software License, unless specific 
needs or security/confidentiality considerations do not allow it. 
In this latter case, a ***Free Software Charge*** might apply.

For further information please feel free to contact the MBDyn team.
