#Contacts

**Note: _this contact form is only for direct contact with the webmaster
or commercial contact with the developers_**.
If you need support for **software usage**, or you think you
are experiencing a software bug, please
write to the
[mbdyn-users@mbdyn.org]({{ "Mailing.html" | relative_url }}) mailing list
(you need to subscribe first).
**Discussion on the mailing list is public and free**.

If you want to participate to **Google Summer of Code**
working at the **MBDyn** project,
please follow the related instructions;
**this page has NOTHING TO DO WITH GSoC**. Note also
the **MBDyn** is **not** going to partecipate in 2023.

Direct support that involves developers' time and
effort may require a **support contract**.
See "[Whom should I post messages to]({{ "Documentation/FAQ.html#whom-should-i-post-messages-to" | relative_url }})"
for more details.
