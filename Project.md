# Project

The **MBDyn** project started as an effort to develop an academic multibody
analysis code to support research on nonlinear mechanical and aeroelastic
system analysis by means of numerical integration.

Eventually it evolved in a powerful multibody multidisciplinary
analysis software tool, which is distributed under GPL 2.1 since
November 2001.
