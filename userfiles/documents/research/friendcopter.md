2004-2008

Contract Number AIP3-CT-2003-502773


6th FP European Research Project. 

The research contribution from 
"[Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Aerospaziali](http://www.aero.polimi.it/en/)" 
(at that time Dipartimento di Ingegneria Aerospaziale) of 
"[Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it)" 
focuses on interior noise (WP4) and smart blades (WP5). **MBDyn** is used 
in the design and optimization of actively twisted rotor blades and in 
the aeroservoelastic simulation of rotorcraft dynamics for performance 
improvement and vibrations reduction.
The activity is currently focusing on the optimization of the 
active twist blade section properties.

Points of contact were Professor Gain Luca Ghiringhelli,
Dr. [Pierangelo Masarati](https://home.aero.polimi.it/masarati) and 
Dr. [Marco Morandini](https://home.aero.polimi.it/morandini) for smart blade optimization.
