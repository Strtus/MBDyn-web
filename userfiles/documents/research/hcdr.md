# Mechanical Systems Modeling
[2005-?]

MBDyn is being evaluated by [Hutchinson](http://www.hutchinson.fr/) _Centre de Recherche_ as a possible solution for arbitrary mechanical systems modeling, to provide support to the analysis of the behavior of mechanical systems featuring their products, mostly rubber components.

Applications include aerospace and automotive systems, as described in [1]. Figure 1 shows the detailed model of generic car suspensions.
