6th FP European Research Project. 

The research contribution from 
"[Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Aerospaziali](https://www.aero.polimi.it/en/)" (at that time Dipartimento di Ingegneria Aerospaziale) of 
"[Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it)" spans the entire project, 
from numerical analysis of aerodynamics, flight mechanics, 
aeroelasticity, structural dynamics, to wind-tunnel testing. 
**MBDyn** is used in the aeroservoelastic and structural dynamics analysis of up to the full-span tiltrotor. 

POLIMI's tasks involve: 

* investigation of model nonlinearity issues in whirl-flutter stability and limit-cycle oscillations (LCO); 
* aeroelastic stability of the rotor; 
* preliminary aeroelastic sizing of the tail; 
* overall aircraft aeroservoelasticity and structural dynamics. 


The sizing of the tail is performed by Luca Cavagna and Giuseppe Quaranta using NeoCASS, a tool developed by POLIMI within the SimSAC project. Professor Sergio Ricci is POLIMI's coordinator of SimSAC. 

Points of contact were Professor Marco Borri (POLIMI coordinator); 
Dr. [Pierangelo Masarati](https://home.aero.polimi.it/morandini) 
(responsible for dynamics related tasks) and 
Dr. [Giuseppe Quaranta](https://home.aero.polimi.it/quaranta), for aeroservoelasticity and structural dynamics.
