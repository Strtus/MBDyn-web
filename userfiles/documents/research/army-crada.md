# Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) for Multibody Formulation for Tiltrotor Aeroelastic Analysis

CRADA 1999-2004

A research agreement between the Department of Aerospace Engineering of the 
University "Politecnico di Milano" and the U.S. Army Research Laboratory
([ARL]("http://www.arl.mil/")), Vehicle Technology Center (VTC, now 
[Vehicle Technology Directorate]("http://www.arl.army.mil/vtd/vtcindex.html")) at the 
[NASA]("http://www.nasa.gov/" [Langley Research Center]("http://www.larc.nasa.gov/"), aimed at developing multibody simulation procedures for the analysis of the aeroservoelasticity of rotorcraft and tiltrotor aircraft. Special attention is dedicated to the dynamic stability of tiltrotors (ground resonance, whirl flutter).
