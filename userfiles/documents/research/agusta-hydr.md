# Integration of Hydraulic Servo-Actuators in Rotorcraft Aeroelasticity 
2000-2002

Agusta Research Contract NM-000/1505. 
 
The research is focused on the analysis of the interaction between the rotor aeroelasticity and the dynamics of the hydraulic control system (see also Helicopter Control System Synthesis by Multibody Multidisciplinary Analysis).
