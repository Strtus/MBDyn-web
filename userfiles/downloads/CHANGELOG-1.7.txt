MBDyn 1.7.3
	Enhancements:
		- added network byte order to drivers & element output streams
		- added width/format for eigenanalysis output files
		  (noted by Reinhard Resch)
		- added relative output of follower force/couple
		- refactored communication code (stream drivers and output
		  elements) to support user-defined communicators (Luca Conti
		  for GSoC 2017)
		- added module-flightgear (Luca Conti for GSoC 2017)
		- added automatic derivatives coefficient estimation
		  (Reinhard Resch)
	Backward compatibility issues:
		- got rid of adams and motionview output support
		- deprecated "drees 2" inflow model (identical to "dreese")
	Known issues:
	Bug fixes:
		- fixed (harmless?) off-by-one read in fixed step drive
		- fixed bugs in timestep control (Reinhard Resch)
		- fixed default max time step (Reinard Resch)
		- fixed build without libmbc (noted by Richard Crozier)
		- fixed test if residual is NaN (Reinard Resch)
		- fixed error message in strext (Richard Crozier)
		- fixed typos and strengthened inflow models

MBDyn 1.7.2
	Enhancements:
		- added contrib/Post (Marco Morandini)
		- added python input file pre-processing (Marco Morandini)
		- added support for Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) model
		  exchange and co-simulation standard (with the contribution
		  of Devyesh Tandon during Google Summer of Code 2016)
		- added "raw" variants of buffer drive and output elem
		- added private data to electric motor (Reinhard Resch)
		- added initial current to electric motor (Reinhard Resch)
		- added printing the CPU time used for each iteration
		  (Reinhard Resch)
		- reduce memory usage during initial assembly (Reinhard Resch)
		- added netcdf output for eigenanalysis (Andrea Zanoni)

		- added several improvements related to automatic
		  differentiation (Reinhard Resch)
		- updated support for CodeAster modal element database
		  generation (Reinhard Resch)
		- improved electric motor (Reinhard Resch)
		- improved module-hydrodynamic_plain_bearing (Reinhard Resch)
			1) Multiple Gauss Points can be used in combination
			   with axial movement of the shaft
			2) It is possible to have eccentricities larger than
			   one (Sommerfeld numbers are extrapolated linear).
			3) Output can be generated for selected Gauss points
			   only
		- added support for user-defined time step control code
		  (With the contribution of Ankit Aggarwal during Google Summer
		  of Code 2016)
