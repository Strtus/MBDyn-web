MBDyn 1.6.1
	Enhancements:
		- added hostname support to utils
		- added module for file drive input from LeapMotion device
		- rod without offset now works with displacement nodes
		- added several modules (Reinhard Resch)
		- added autodiff vectorialization (Reinhard Resch)
		- added support for OpenBLAS (Reinhard Resch)
		- added support for UDP to socket-based communication
		- added configurable types to socket-based communication
		- added Bezier-based rod joint (Andrea Zanoni)
	Backward compatibility issues:
	Known issues:
		- aeromodal with rigid-body motion needs work
		- deformable displacement joint initial assembly broken
		- modal joint initial assembly with initial modal disp. broken
	Bug fixes:
		- fixed build with RTAI configured without inlining
		- fixed math parser bug with function calls in expressions
		- fixed deadlock in recursive string parser calls
		- fixed echo of modal joint record 12 (noted by Timothy Jim)
		- fixed Windows build of mbdyn_util_oct.oct (Reinhard Resch)
		- fixed mode label in ModalExt output (noted by Timothy Jim)
		- fixed (multithread) build in MinGW64 (Reinhard Resch)

MBDyn 1.6.0
	Enhancements:

		- added automatic differentiation support to drive callers
		  and constitutive laws (Reinhard Resch)
		- added (optional) modal joint reaction forces output
		- added runtime loadable file drivers
		- added generic joystick driver (module-hid)
		- added run-time loadable "description" registration
		- added "namespace" stmt (module-namespace)
		- added symbol table in namespaces (module-namespace)
	Backward compatibility issues:
	Known issues:
		- Schur solver is broken
		- TotalPinJoint inverse dynamics support is broken
		- RTAI and multithread support incompatible
		- module-octave and multithread support incompatible
	Bug fixes:
		- fix module-octave build and scripts installation
		  (Reinhard Resch)
		- fix initial assembly of viscoelastic deformable joint
		  (noted by Reinhard Resch)
